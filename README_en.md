# RimWorld_IdeologyPatch

Here's some tweaks that I made to alter something I thought not too reasonable while playing RimWorld. Feel free to use it so long as you have the same feeling as me.

Currently changes:
1. Colonists now ask for age reversal treatment after they have benn older than 25/80 of their life expectancy. (While playing Hardcore-SK, there are races whose life expectancy goes way beyond 80 (e.g. 1000) while still asks for a treatment.)
